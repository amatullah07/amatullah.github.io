Graphics and Multimedia = visuals, sounds, motion, everything that makes a website feel alive.
They’re not just decoration. They help explain, engage, and literally bring the page to life.

Computer Graphics
Computer graphics are pictures or videos made with computers. They changed how we make movies, games, ads, and digital art.
 There are two main types:
Raster: These are made of tiny dots called pixels. They’re mostly great unless you zoom in. (Example of a raster tool I’ve used: Adobe Photoshop)
Vector: Made of curves and math-based lines. They never lose quality even if you zoom in. (Example of a raster tool I’ve used: Adobe Illustrator)


Raster editors (like Photoshop, GIMP, Paint.NET) work with pixels.
Vector editors (like Illustrator, CorelDRAW, Inkscape) work with lines and shapes.
So basically, raster = photos, vector = drawings.

Adding Images with HTML
You use the <img> tag to show pictures.
Example:
<img src="example.jpg" alt="description of image">

src = where the image is stored
alt = text that shows if the image can’t load (and helps with accessibility).
Keep image files in your “images” folder, name them clearly, and always use smaller file sizes so your page loads fast.

Multimedia
This is the combo of all types of media like text, sound, video, animation, interactivity.
It can be linear (pre-determines for the user) or non-linear (you control it, like games or interactive lessons).
Also can be live or recorded.
Multimedia shows up in almost every field like education, business, entertainment, ads, medicine, even research.
It’s also getting more advanced with haptic tech (feeling vibrations/touch) and new ideas like smell/taste simulations which is cool

HTML for Audio and Video:
Supported formats:
Audio: MP3, WAV, AAC, OGG, FLAC
Video: MP4, WebM, OGG


Streaming means you can watch or listen while it’s loading (like YouTube). Downloading means waiting until it’s done.

Lesson takeaways:
This lesson literally connects design and coding.
Now I get how media affects load speed, looks, and accessibility which is all super important for UI/UX.
Raster vs Vector finally makes full sense, and I actually wanna try embedding audio or a short video next time I code a page.
