<h2>Graphics and Multimedia</h2>
<ul>
    <li>These are visuals, sounds, motion, everything that makes a website feel alive.</li>
    <li>They’re not just decoration. They help explain, engage, and literally bring the page to life.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Computer Graphics</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Computer graphics are pictures or videos made with computers. They changed how we make movies, games, ads, and digital art.</li>
    <li>There are two main types:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Raster: These are made of tiny dots called pixels. They’re mostly great unless you zoom in. (Example of a raster tool I’ve used: Adobe Photoshop)</li>
        <li>Vector: Made of curves and math-based lines. They never lose quality even if you zoom in. (Example of a raster tool I’ve used: Adobe Illustrator)</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Raster editors (like Photoshop, GIMP, Paint.NET) work with pixels.</li>
    <li>Vector editors (like Illustrator, CorelDRAW, Inkscape) work with lines and shapes.</li>
    <li>So basically, raster = photos, vector = drawings.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Adding Images with HTML</h2>
You use the img tag to show pictures.
-Example:
img src="example.jpg" alt="description of image" - all this being inside <>
<ul>
    <li>src = where the image is stored</li>
    <li>alt = text that shows if the image can’t load (and helps with accessibility).</li>
    <li>Keep image files in your “images” folder, name them clearly, and always use smaller file sizes so your page loads fast.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Multimedia</h2>
<ul>
    <li>This is the combo of all types of media like text, sound, video, animation, interactivity.</li>
    <li>It can be linear (pre-determines for the user) or non-linear (you control it, like games or interactive lessons).</li>
    <li>Also can be live or recorded.</li>
    <li>Multimedia shows up in almost every field like education, business, entertainment, ads, medicine, even research.</li>
    <li>It’s also getting more advanced with haptic tech (feeling vibrations/touch) and new ideas like smell/taste simulations which is really cool.</li>
</ul>
<h2>HTML for Audio and Video:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Supported formats:</li>
<ol>
    <li>Audio: MP3, WAV, AAC, OGG, FLAC</li>
    <li>Video: MP4, WebM, OGG</li>
</ol>
<li><i>Streaming </i>means you can watch or listen while it’s loading (like YouTube). </li>
<li><i>Downloading</i> means waiting until it’s done.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lesson takeaways:</h2>
<p>This lesson literally connects design and coding. Now I get how media affects load speed, looks, and accessibility which is all super important for UI/UX. Raster vs Vector finally makes full sense, and I actually wanna try embedding audio or a short video next time I code a page.</p>
