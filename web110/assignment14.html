    <h1>WEB110 GANTT CHART FOR FINAL</h1> 
    <p>
      For my WEB 110 final project, I want to create a clean, multi-page HTML website that explains the major topics from Unit 11: Graphics and Multimedia. Each page will focus on one topic, like image formats, video, audio, animation, and how multimedia works on the web, using simple explanations and examples so it feels like a mini learning site. I’ll follow the plan shown in my Gantt chart: first writing the script for what I want to say, then finalizing the content and starting the code. After that, I’ll add all the CSS and a little JavaScript to make the site look polished and interactive. Once the styling is done, I’ll build out the separate pages, start formatting everything so it’s consistent, and then check the code for errors. My goal is to make a small but visually nice project that actually shows the multimedia concepts we learned, instead of just explaining them.

  <h1>LEARNING OUTCOMES FROM LESSON 14</h1>
  <p>
    From this lesson, I learned that project management is basically a structured way to plan and complete a project with clear goals, a timeline, and defined tasks. I now understand the five phases: initiating, planning, executing, monitoring, and closing, and how each step keeps the work organized. I also learned that every project has constraints like scope, time, and budget, and those are what the manager has to balance. The section on planning showed me how tools like schedules, task breakdowns, and risk checks help keep things on track. I also learned that stakeholders matter because they can influence the project’s success. Overall, the reading showed me that project management is mainly about coordination, clarity, and staying aligned with the goals.
