    <h1> Learning Outcome From Unit 08</h1>
  <div>
      <p>Coincidentally, I had to watch Personal Information Management (PIM) videos and Digital Security videos at my job this week. So watching and reading this Unit felt nice as I already knew some stuff from in here.
    
    Below are paragraphs I wrote along when I did the reading and watching the videos. I also made bullet points in the end that will help me when I turn back to these notes.
</p>

  <p>The readings made the threats feel real: phishing, ransomware, spyware: basically anything that sneaks in when you click dumb links or overshare PII. It broke down the scary words into real-life moments (like “that sketchy email” or “odd download”), which actually made me care about the tiny habits that protect you. Usually, I allow all cookies and don’t really care about visiting fishy websites, maybe not anymore though.</p>

<p>On the protection side, the basics are huge: HTTPS/encryption, multi-factor authentication, password managers, firewalls, and keeping software updated. Tech helps, but the readings kept reminding me that user choices matter most and that one bad click undoes a lot. The ethics stuff also stood out: IT pros must protect data and respect privacy, which really highlighted responsibility.</p>

<p>The student presentation looked really clean and useful. I took notes on layout, simple visuals, and quick demos I want to copy for my final project.
I actually changed my Chrome privacy settings after the lesson which felt productive. 
Funny moment: I tried the EICAR antivirus test file and got a 404 that was kinda phishy-looking itself, so the whole thing reminded me to always double-check test sources. I’m not sure if it was, but the moment was pretty funny for me. <span style='font-size:35 px;'>&#128517;</span> </p>
