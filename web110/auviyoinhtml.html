<h1>Audio, Video and Youtube in HTML</h1>
<p>
HTML lets you play audio and video with simple tags like "audio" and "video" with controls.

Adding controls gives people play, pause, and volume buttons.

Different browsers like different video formats, so sometimes you need more than one file type.

YouTube embeds are easy because YouTube handles the quality and storage for you.

Autoplay is usually annoying for users, so most browsers block it anyway.

Always try to include captions or transcripts so everyone can understand the content.
