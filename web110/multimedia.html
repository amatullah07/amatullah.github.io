<h1>Multimedia</h1>
<ul>
<li>Multimedia is just mixing things like text, pictures, audio, video, and animations in one place.</li>

<li>It helps explain ideas better than plain text because people learn through different senses.</li>

<li>A page with visuals or a short clip is usually easier to understand than just paragraphs.</li>

<li>But too much media can slow down a site, so you have to pick what’s actually helpful.</li>

<li>Adding alt text, captions, and clear visuals keeps your site accessible for everyone.</li>

<li>When used well, multimedia makes learning smoother and websites more interesting.</li>
</ul>
