<h1>Multimedia</h1>

<p>Multimedia is just mixing things like text, pictures, audio, video, and animations in one place.

It helps explain ideas better than plain text because people learn through different senses.

A page with visuals or a short clip is usually easier to understand than just paragraphs.

But too much media can slow down a site, so you have to pick what’s actually helpful.

Adding alt text, captions, and clear visuals keeps your site accessible for everyone.

When used well, multimedia makes learning smoother and websites more interesting.</p>
