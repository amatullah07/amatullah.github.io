    <title> Learning Outcome from Unit 09 </title>
      <h1> style="color: white;">Learning Outcome From Unit 09 </h1>
    <p>I broke down this Unit's learning into the followimg subtopics.</p>
    <h2>Summary from Readings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>HTML is the standard markup language used for web view, which is often used with CSS (enhances style) and JavaScript (scripting language).</li>
      <li>It was first mentioned on the internet by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991.</li>
      <li>The latest version used is HTML5.</li>
      <li>There are two types of HTML editors. Text Editors helps us to write and edit HTML code Examples are: Github and VS Code. “What you see is what you get” or WYSIWYG Editors help you look at the output as you type the input html.</li> 
    </ul>
    <h2>Youtube Videos</h2>
    <p>The Learn HTML in 12 Minutes video was really nostalgic. It did remind me of two important tags that I forgot- <br> and the <head> tags.</p>
<h2>Tutorials</h2>
<p>I did the TutorialsPoint reading and the Quiz, here are my results:</p>
<p>I also tried doing the SoloLearn Course but it gave me an error 404 </p>

    <h2>Validating Web Page</h2>
    <p>The W3C HTML checker is amazing! I tried it with my Assignment 08 and it gave me warnings and errors that I’m supposed to be checking. It’s cool that this was done in seconds!</p>

    <p>Overall, I was glad we finally came to Unit 09. The past lessons were helpful for me to revise my html and now I know that it’s part of my learning. </p>
