    <h1>LEARNING OUTCOMES FROM LESSON 15</h1> 
    <h4>Career Objective and Plan</h4>
    <p>My goal is to be a web designer for small businesses, teach part-time about Islam and comparative religion, and stay involved in business administration or management. My plan is to keep growing my design skills through school and projects, build teaching experience through tutoring and community work, and take on admin or management roles so I can eventually lead teams or start my own business.</p>

    <h4>Unit Summary</h4>
    <p>This unit helped me understand how wide the IT field really is and how many different career paths it offers. Learning about roles like web developers, database administrators, and cybersecurity professionals showed me how each job uses different skills and fits into the tech world. I also learned the importance of career planning, networking, and constantly updating my skills. I am glad I was able to modify my LinkedIn account (I was delaying it for a long time) and I looked at this unit as a guide for me as to how career works. Overall, this unit made me think more clearly about my own future in tech and how I can prepare for it starting now. </p>
