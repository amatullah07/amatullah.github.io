<h1 style="color:MidnightBlue;"> Learning Outcome from Lesson 07</h1>
<p>This was one of the lessons that looked hard at the first glance, but it seemed clear after actually studying it. Youtube animations and other videos in general made the hard-sounding words look easy! Below are subtopics and what I learnt from these specific lessons.</p>

<b>TutorialsPoint: Internet Reference Models</b>
<ul>
  <li>Reference models are standardized methods to help devices communicate with each other.</li>
  <li>OSI and TCP/IP are two reference models. </li>
  <li>The TCP/IP model uses four layers whereas the OSI Model has seven layers.</li>
</ul>

<b>TutorialsPoint: Internet Protocol</b>
<ul>
  <li>TCP means transmission control protocol and it is a standard for connections via networks.</li>
  <li>It helps our data arrive correctly in the right order.</li>
  <li>It offers six services at the application layer.</li>
  <li>IP has to pair with a reliable TCP network to ensure correct transmission of data.</li>
  <li>Other transfer protocols include- UDp, FTP, TFTP, Telnet and HTTP.</li>
</ul>
  
<b>TutorialsPoint: Internet Domain Name System</b>
<ul>
  <li>DNS is a naming scheme. DNS is like the internet phonebook with easy names for IP addresses.</li>
  <li>There are two types of URLs- 
  1) Absolute URL has the complete name. For example: http is the protocol, docs.google.com is the server name and index.htm is the path name.
  2)Relative urls are used for internal links like hyperlinks on a wikipedia page.</li>
</ul> 


Youtube: Computer Networks Crash Course
Area networks-
LAN: For close networks like two students in a class or the entire college campus.
Ethernet uses MAC addresses to send data exactly where it is intended.
Circuit Switching was used earlier to connect to a specific network, for example: Phone calls.
Message Switching: Current postal system. Will have stops in between before reaching the final destination. Hop paths are the stops that the message takes and these are to track our data.
Packets: They contain the destination address of where the information is supposed to be, so routers can access and send them. These use the IP protocol. 
ARPANET was the worldâ€™s first packet-switched network.

Youtube: How does the INTERNET work?
Everything comes from a specific data center to you. The way this connection works is through Optical Fiber Cables that connect the data center and the device.
All sorts of information like this is managed by ICANN in the USA.
The animations were actually great in this video and the complex words made sense!

Takeaways from other readings/videos:
VPN: Basically a private and safe network connection. 
Intranet vs. Extranet: Intranet is a private network for organization employees, whereas extranet extends the network to selected partners/customers. For example: Blackboard is exclusive for Harper students, making it extranet and extra apps like HIP or RaisersEdge could be known as Intranet.
