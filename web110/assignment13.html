    <p>For this assignment, I will write down the SQL Statements for the required prompts as given in the assignment details. It requires statements for SELECT, INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE. While I was able to test the SQL Statements for SELECT, W3Schools gave an error when I tried to run the INSERT,DELETE and UPDATE statements. This was because Google Chrome (my browser) no longer supports WebSQL.</p>

<h3>Create a paragraph and unordered list for the single-table SELECT statements. Include a separate list item for the SQL used to generate each statement in the activity. The first item / statement would be SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS;</h3>
<ol>
<strong><li>Select all customers (SELECT *).</li></strong>
SELECT * FROM Customers;

<strong><li>Select only customer id and customer name fields (SELECT fields).</li></strong>
SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName FROM Customers;

<strong><li>Select customer name, address, city, and postal code for all customers from the United Kingdom (WHERE field = 'value').</li></strong>
SELECT CustomerName, Address, City, PostalCode
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'United Kingdom';

<strong><li>Select contact name and customer name for all customers, sorted alphabetically by contact name (ORDER BY field).</li></strong>
SELECT ContactName, CustomerName
FROM Customers
ORDER BY ContactName;

<strong><li>Count the total number of customers (COUNT(*)).</li></strong>
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Customers;

<strong><li>Count the number of customers from each country (GROUP BY).</li></strong>
SELECT Country, COUNT(*)
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country;

<strong><li>Count the number of customers from each country and sort the list in descending order by count and ascending order by country in case of a tie (GROUP BY, ORDER BY).</li></strong>
SELECT Country, COUNT(*)
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC, Country ASC;

<strong><li>Count the number of customers from each country and sort the list in descending order by count and ascending order by country in case of a tie, listing only those countries with more than 10 customers (GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY).</li></strong>
SELECT Country, COUNT(*)
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC, Country ASC;
</ol>

<h3>Create a paragraph and unordered list for the INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements. Include a separate list item for the SQL used to generate each statement in the activity.</h3>

<ol>
<strong><li>Add a new shipper with ID 4, name 'On Time Delivery', and phone '(503) 555 0123' (INSERT).</li></strong>
INSERT INTO Shippers (ShipperID, ShipperName, Phone)
VALUES (4, 'On Time Delivery', '(503) 555 0123');
<strong><li>Increase prices on all products by 1 (UPDATE).</li></strong>
UPDATE Products
SET Price = Price + 1;
<strong><li>Reduce prices on all products by 1 (UPDATE).</li></strong>
UPDATE Products
SET Price = Price - 1;
<strong><li>Change the new shipper's name from 'On Time Delivery' to 'On-Time Delivery' (UPDATE, WHERE).</li></strong>
UPDATE Shippers
SET ShipperName = 'On-Time Delivery'
WHERE ShipperID = 4;
<strong><li>Delete the new shipper (DELETE, WHERE).</li></strong>
DELETE FROM Shippers
WHERE ShipperID = 4;
</ol>
