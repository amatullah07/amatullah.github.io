<h1>Images in HTML</h1>
<p>
The img  tag tells the browser to go get an image and show it on the page.

The src is the image’s location. If the path is wrong, nothing shows.

alt text helps screen readers and shows a description when the image can’t load.

Your images should be the right size so your site doesn’t load slowly.

Keeping your images in a folder keeps things organized and prevents broken images.

Most slow websites are slow because of big images, so choosing good formats helps a lot.
