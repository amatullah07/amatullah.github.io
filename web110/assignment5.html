      <h1> Learning Outcome from Lesson 05</h1>
      <font size="6"> 
        Best unit so far! While all other assignments from earlier weeks had some sort of research needed, this one was the easiest. It had information most of us already know and it kind of felt like maybe how new users to social media found about it during its beginning.

TutorialsPoint: Social Networking
It gave a list of a few social networking services, most of them are common while some like FaceParty, Ibibo and Line are unheard of. Social networking helps in almost every aspect of online communications. 

GCFLearnFree Tutorials
All these readings were basic ideas to what the respective social media application does, most of them being those applications that we use on a daily basis.

SmartInsights: The Honeycomb Model
The reason for creating this model is to why do users use social media? This kind of information helps many people target their audiences really well based on the aspects of social media listed in the model.

Wikipedia: Web 2.0
The World Wide Web grew enormously over the years. This term denotes the largest second shift in the World Wide Web and Web Design fields. Web 2.0 gave rise to constant communication through social networking sites. 

Semantic Web
It refers to the kind of web we use today, that allows the web to better understand us. Its when the web understands our actual needs and provides us with accurate information as we expected. 

Folksonomy
This is a user generated system to classify information on social media to have easier access. Examples include hashtags, Reddit tags or Pinterest boards. This contradicts with taxonomy, which is a pre-structured and pre-defined classified system.

Bots
These are non-human programs that are meant to mimic human interactions on social media. As far as I know, most bots are used for increasing followers or subscribers, basically to grow content for a social network group.

The Quizlet in the end was basically the best unit summary I have ever seen and it really helped me understand that I did understand the lesson.
