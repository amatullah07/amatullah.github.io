   <h1>Learning outcome from Assignment 02</h1>
  <p>This lesson made me really understand how and why we actually use web browsers. As someone who explored browsers before, I've always preferred Chrome. I used this unit as an opportunity for me to dive into Web browser basics, especially Chrome. Below, I have listed evry sub-heading that could be found on the Wikiversity page, and what I learnt from it.</p>

 <p>Overall this lesson helped me understand more web browsers, their applications and how they were invented for users. I have always used Chrome since I loved the UI, as it seemed clear and minimalistic. I use Internet Explorer at my job and a few lessons from this unit made the browser seem easy to me in terms of browsing well. </p>
