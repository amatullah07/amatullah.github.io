<h1>Computer Graphics</h1>
<ul>
        <li>Computer graphics are just computer-made pictures, and they mainly come in two types.</li>
        <li><strong>Raster graphics </strong>are made of tiny colored squares. When you zoom in, you can see the little pixels.</li>
        <li><strong>Vector graphics</strong> are made from shapes and math, so they stay smooth no matter how big you make them.</li>
        <li>Photos are usually raster because they need a lot of detail.</li>
        <li>Logos and icons are often vector because they need to stay sharp on any screen.</li>
        <li>Think of raster like phone photos and vector like clean cartoon-style logos.</li>
    </ul>
