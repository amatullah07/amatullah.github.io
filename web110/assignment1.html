<h1>Learning Outcome from Assignment 01 </h1>
<p>The basic definitions of Internet and different related resources of the Internet that I learnt this unit made me feel like I was defining things that I always knew without a fixed definition. Stuff like the internet, browser, downloading and IP address are never really something you learn in a class, but is knowledge you perceive at a basic stage in life without pondering over them. This introduction felt like a <i>definitive assignment</i> to stuff we knew.</p>

<b>Ideas that were a revision for me:</b>
<ol>
<li>Internet and World Wide Web origin</li>I
<li>CANN responsible for DNS and IP Addresses.</li>I
<li>The Internet is “the hub” for all web addresses and started replacing traditional communication.</li>
</ol>


<b>Ideas that were new to me:</b>
<ol>
<li>W3C used as web’s official standards organization</li>
<li>SSL is the little lock that protects website security</li>
<li>ARPANET first network created</li>
<li>nternet has no centralized or individual authority</li>I
</li>HTTP is also a language!</li>
<li>Github in easy high-school words is the Google docs for coding. You know changes you make, add collaborators on your code and keep track of the code project.</li>
</ol>
