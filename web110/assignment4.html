     <p>This unit felt easy at first, but as we delved into definitions and internal understanding on an email, it felt really new. I wrote down everything I learnt in bullet lists so I can refer to them easily to learn for further exams. </p>
<ol>
  <li>Message headers like CC, BCC, Reply and Forward are found when writing/sending an email</li>
  <li>POP3 was the original standard protocol used for emails until IMAP was getting recognized more. The main difference between them is that IMAP stores any changed info across various devices, whereas POP3 will only do that to a particular device. Gmail is an email application that uses IMAP.</li> 
  <li>SMTP sends and receives email using MTA, which transfers these messages. MTA is a software application, whereas SMTP is a protocol.</li>
  <li>Mozilla Thunderbird is an application that lets you use different email applications (Like Gmail and Yahoo) under one place. It is great for organizations to not mix up emails and still use different email applications under one system.</li>
<li>If a URL starts with mailto:, it can create a hyperlink for the email addressee that follows. I usually found these in websites under Contact Me.</li>
  <li>Snail Mail is a term used for traditional paper mail.</li>
  <li>Anything after the @ is the domain name.</li>
  <li>Address book: Contact information of your personal email contacts</li>
  <li>We do have disadvantages of emails such as cyber crime related to forgery, late replies, unwanted spam and delay in response to urgent matters.</li>
  <li>MIME is the format that lets an email add attachments, basically anything other than normal English texts on an email.</li>
  <li>Pretty Good Privacy helps you secure your data encryption. It is used by major businesses to ensure that their data is protected.</li>
 <li>S/MIME is the encrypted version of the regular MIME.</li> 
<li>Netiquette is the Net Etiquette that helps people that use the internet follow a certain set of guidelines to ensure a secure cyberspace.</li>
</ol>
    <p>Overall, this unit showed me how email works behind the scenes and how these technical tools make it easy for common users like me to understand technology smoothly.</p>
